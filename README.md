# Bit Manipulation in C

This project demonstrates basic bit manipulation functions in C:
- `SetBit`: Sets a specific bit to 1
- `ClearBit`: Sets a specific bit to 0
- `FlipBit`: Toggles a specific bit
- `GetBit`: Reads the value of a specific bit
- `BitCount`: Calculates how many bits are needed to represent a number

## Compilation
```bash
gcc bit_operations.c -o bit_operations
